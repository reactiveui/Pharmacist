### What does it do?

The EventBuilder will convert events within an assembly and create observable wrappers for them. 

It can generate the observables for the following:
* System Platforms, such as Xamarin (iOS/Android/TVOS/Tizen), UWP
* NuGet packages
* Assemblies.

There is a MSBuild Task version and a global tool version.
