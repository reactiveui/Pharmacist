### What does it do?

Pharmacist will convert events within an assembly and create observable wrappers for them. 

It has been called pharmacist since it will generate Reactive Extensions (Rx) Observables for events, so it's a play on word about "Rx" which is short for prescriptions.

It can generate the observables for the following:
* System Platforms, such as Xamarin (iOS/Android/TVOS), UWP
* NuGet packages
* Assemblies.

There is a MSBuild Task version and a global tool version.
