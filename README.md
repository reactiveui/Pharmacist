# Pharmacist

Builds observables from events.

## NuGet Packages

Install the following packages to start using Pharmacist.

## What does it do?

Pharmacist will convert events within an assembly and create observable wrappers for them. 

It has been called pharmacist since it will generate Reactive Extensions (Rx) Observables for events, so it's a play on word about "Rx" which is short for prescriptions.

It can generate the observables for the following:
* System Platforms, such as Xamarin (iOS/Android/TVOS), UWP
* NuGet packages
* Assemblies.

There is a MSBuild Task version and a global tool version.

## How do I use?

### MsBuild

Pharmacist can automatically create Observable wrappers for projects for their explicitly included NuGet packages.

In your .csproj file you can add:

```xml
<ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="Pharmacist.MsBuild" Version="1.*" PrivateAssets="all" />
    <PackageReference Include="Pharmacist.Common" Version="1.*" />
</ItemGroup>
```

`Pharmacist.MsBuild` contains the MsBuild target file and appropriate tasks. `Pharmacist.Common` includes common source code that is required to invoke the generated observables.

This will generate wrappers only for other included `PackageReference`'s contained within the project file.

For example if you had a inclusion for `Xamarin.Forms` in the same project that includes Pharmacist it will generate Observable wrappers for the included codes. It will not include any child `PackageReference` from other projects included via a `ProjectReference`. You can override that functionality by including `<PharmacistGlobalPackages>true</PharmacistGlobalPackages>` in a `PropertyGroup` inside your project.

Also it will only generate the specified `ProjectReference` and none of it's dependent packages. For example for a ProjectReference inclusion of `ReactiveUI`, it will not generate dependencies such as `System.Reactive`. If you want to generate observable wrappers for the dependent NuGet packages you must explicitly include them. 

### Command Line

Pharmacist comes with a command line version which is useful for generating for a specified platform.

The following values are supported for platforms: `Android`, `iOS`, `Mac`, `WPF`, `UWP`, `Winforms`, `TVOS`

Install the global tool:

```Batchfile
dotnet tool install -g Pharmacist
```

To generate files:

```Batchfile
pharmacist generate-platform -p <Platform> -o c:/directory/for/output --output-prefix="Events"
```

This would generate a file named `Events_<Platform>.cs`, where Platform would be the platform specified.

In the near future this will be changing to TargetFramework with /wpf and /winforms options.
