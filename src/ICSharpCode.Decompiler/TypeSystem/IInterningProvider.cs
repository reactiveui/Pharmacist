	/// Provider used for interning.
	/// </summary>
	/// <remarks>
	/// A simple IInterningProvider implementation could use 3 dictionaries:
	///  1. using value equality comparer (for certain types known to implement value equality, e.g. string and IType)
	///  2. using comparer that calls into ISupportsInterning (for types implementing ISupportsInterning)
	///  3. list comparer (for InternList method)
	/// 
	/// On the first Intern()-call, the provider tells the object to prepare for interning (ISupportsInterning.PrepareForInterning)
	/// and stores it into a dictionary. On further Intern() calls, the original object is returned for all equal objects.
	/// This allows reducing the memory usage by using a single object instance where possible.
	/// 
	/// Interning provider implementations could also use the interning logic for different purposes:
	/// for example, it could be used to determine which objects are used jointly between multiple type definitions
	/// and which are used only within a single type definition. Then a persistent file format could be organized so
	/// that shared objects are loaded only once, yet non-shared objects get loaded lazily together with the class.
	/// </remarks>
